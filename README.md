# The Saga of Erik The Red (Vinland)
An alternate history, total conversion mod for Crusader Kings III where the Norse decide to stay in North America.
This mod is a total conversion mod, meaning it overhauls almost everything in the game.
There is a new map, new cultures, religions, characters, etc.

# Installation
The easiest method is to subscribe to the mod on Steam Workshop. You will automatically get the most up to date version.
If you wish to install this manually, then place this in your (TODO) folder.
